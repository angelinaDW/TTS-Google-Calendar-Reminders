# TTS-Google-Calendar-Reminders

TTS-Google-Calendar-Reminders is a small Python program that gives you TTS reminders about upcoming events from your Google Calendar.
By default, it will remind you 5 minutes before upcoming events, by saying "Hey {user}! Your event, {event} is coming up in approximately X minutes and Y seconds."
It will also remind you when your event starts.


## Setup
In order to use this, you will need to set up a developer api key for google calendar. You should be able to do that by following the instructions here:
https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python

Then, will need to download your credentials.json file, and place it in the same folder as the python files. After that, it should work.

Please let me know if you have any issues setting it up!

## Questions and Answers

* How buggy is it?

Very. This project is just something that I hacked together in under a day. It's still full of bugs right now, but I intend to try to fix them as I encounter them.
As of right now, *you should NOT rely on this as your only reminder system for meetings/other events you need to attend.*
* Will you add X cool feature?

Right now, I'm focused on making sure the project works properly with the features it has. So, it depends on the complexity of the feature, but the answer is likely "not for a while."

Thank you so much for stopping by. :)
